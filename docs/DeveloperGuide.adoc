== Introduction

Welcome fellow developer! We hope that you have as much fun developing Contags as we did. Good luck!

Contags is a platform for storing and managing contacts and their associated particulars and other information. It provides you with a set of core APIs which you can use to concentrate on the production, editing and publishing of enhancements, new features and documentation.

In order to be a successful Contags developer, you will need a general
understanding of: +

• Contags's architecture and object model +

• How features are implemented using the UI, Logic, Model and Storage components.

The sections below give a more detailed overview and implementation of the design of Contags. Do take a look before getting started on using Contags! +

== Setting up

Before you can start working on the code, you have to ensure that your system is configured correctly. This section provides the necessary information and resources to help you get started.

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Firstly, fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer.
. Next, open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first).
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle.
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`.
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK.
. Click `Import Project`.
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`.
. Click `Open as Project`.
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings.
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands.
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS).
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`.
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order.

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements.
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`.

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `CS2103AUG2017-T16-B4/main` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `CS2103AUG2017-T16-B4/main`), you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based).

==== Getting started with coding

Once you've completed the steps above and are ready to start coding, get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.

== Design

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 3.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram (Figure 3.1.1)_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
You can find the `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. +
If you would like to update a diagram: +
1. Modify the diagram in the `.pptx` file as desired +
2. Select the objects of the diagram, +
3. Choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for:

* At app launch: Initializing the components in the correct sequence, and connecting them with each other.
* At shut down: Shutting down the components and invoking cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple components. Two of these classes play important roles at the architecture level, namely:

* `EventsCenter` : Used by components to communicate with other components using events (class written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design).
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : Acts as the interaction link (user interface) between the user and application.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : Executes Commands.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components:

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the _class diagram (Figure 3.1.2)_ given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram (Figure 3.1.3a)_ below shows how the components interact in a scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `ContagsChangedEvent` when the Contags data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The _Sequence Diagram (Figure 3.1.3b)_ below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us to reduce direct coupling between components.

You can look at the sections below for more details of each component.

=== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. +

For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`].

The `UI` component can do the following:

* Execute user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Bind itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` changes.
* Respond to events raised from various parts of Contags and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 2.3.1_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated in a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `UI`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.3.1 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

=== Model component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`:

* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* Stores the data of Contags.
* Exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list changes.
* Does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component:

* Can save the `UserPref` object in json format and read it back.
* Can save the data of Contags in xml format and read it back.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.Contags.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modify the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommand`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1a : Logic Command class diagram_

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command is executed. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1b : Undo/Redo starting stack diagram_

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1c : Undo/Redo new command stack diagram_

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1d : Undo/Redo execute undo stack diagram_

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, there are no other commands left to be undone and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1e : Undo/Redo sequence diagram_

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, there are no other commands left to be redone and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1f : Undo/Redo new command part 1_

Commands that cannot be undone are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.1g : Undo/Redo new command part 2_

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]
_Figure 4.1h : Undo/Redo activity diagram_

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]

=== Remark mechanism

`Remark` functions as an additional Optional field for a `Person`. It exists separately from tags, and does not interfere with its function.

During initialising of a new `Person`, the `Remark` field is not able to be filled, and it generates an empty `Remark` instead. Both the `add` and `edit` commands are unable to modify the `Remark` field of any given `Person`.

The following sequence diagram shows the execution of the RemarkCommand.

image::RemarkCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3.5.1 : Remark Command sequence diagram_

[NOTE]
The `index` field of the `RemarkCommand` uses the indexing of the filtered list that is currently being shown, not the list of all persons.

The implementation of `RemarkCommand` is similar to that of the `EditCommand`. As such, the `updatePerson()` method found in the `ModelManager` is utilised.

Since `Remark` is an optional field, the value of `remarkText` may be null. In this case, the `Remark` field of the person at `index` will be cleared.

To create a difference between the updating and clearing of the `Remark` field, the `CommandResult` of `RemarkCommand` will differ based on the new contents of the `Remark`. This will also provide some additional clarity to users when using the command.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** How `RemarkCommand` executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Follow logic of `edit` command, to generate a new person with an updated `Remark` field and write over the existing `Person` +
**Pros:** Follows an existing style, making it easier to implement and troubleshoot. +
**Cons:** Seems unintuitive to create a new `Person` to edit a field that cannot be modified by the `edit` command. +
**Alternative 2:** Create a `setRemark()` method to modify the `Remark` field of the existing selected `Person` +
**Pros:** Would be very simple to implement. +
**Cons:** As the `RemarkCommand` requires the input of an `index`, we require to interface with the list of persons already existing in the Contags. These methods however, return lists of `ReadOnlyPerson`, which do not allow the inclusion of a `setReamrk()` method. This would require changes elsewhere in the project that would affect other aspects.

---

**Aspect:** Separation of `Remark` from `add` and `edit` commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Do not allow `add` and `edit` to add a `Remark` +
**Pros:** The desired outcome was to experience the development of an entirely new infrastructure for a new command, and to modify 2 existing commands would not have the same educational effect. +
**Cons:** Unintuitive to have a separate command simply for 1 field. +
**Alternative 2:** Allow `add` and `edit` to add a `Remark` +
**Pros:** Is more intuitive for the user, and is simpler to implement the logic of the command. +
**Cons:** Is not as challenging to implement and does not possess the same educational value.

---

**Aspect:** Source of `index` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use the current filtered list that is displayed +
**Pros:** It is intuitive to use the index that is currently being displayed in the ui. +
**Cons:** It does not allow any `Person` that is not currently in the filtered list to have their `Remark` edited. +
**Alternative 2:** Use the list of all persons +
**Pros** It allows all persons, even those not currently being shown, to have their `Remark` edited. +
**Cons** The user will find it difficult to know the `index` of the `Person` he would like to edit, particularly if it is not currently in the filtered list. It is not intuitive and difficult for the user to utilise.

=== Birthday Field

The person class consists of five compulsory attributes, `Name` `Phone` `Email` `Address` `Birthday` and optional `Remark` and `Tag`. The implementation of the birthday attribute is similar to that of the other compulsory attributes. It is a compulsory field and cannot be left blank. The constructor takes in the birthday value in a String format and a new instance of the birthday field is initialised.

The birthday value is validated before being accepted as a parameter in the constructor for the person class. A valid birthday value has to be in the form `DD/MM/YYYY` or `DD/MM/YY`. Only digits and forward slashes are permitted. The birthday value is also checked to ensure that the date actually exists. The different number of days in the month February in leap years are accounted for and the different days in various months are also taken into account. This check minimises the chances of the user making a typo in entering the birthday and also ensures that the user does not accidentally input a wrong field in place of the birthday field (i.e. input an address in the birthday field).

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of birthday field +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new birthday field to all files containing the other fields (name, phone, address, email). +
**Pros:** We will not lose any other functionality as it is now just an additional part of the default behaviour. Existing classes and commands do not have to know that the birthday field exists, barring Add and Edit command. It is also easy for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Design is not modular and has high dependency. +
**Alternative 2:** Create a new class completely for optional fields such as birthday field +
**Pros:** Does not involve the existing template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Methods of the birthday field that are inherited from the other fields must remember to call the super methods, or lose the ability to perform like the other fields.

---

**Aspect:** Whether it should be an optional field (can be left blank) +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Birthday field currently cannot be an empty field. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement and easy for new developers to understand the implementation and work on it. +
**Cons:** Not very user-friendly as not all users would want to add birthdays for all their contacts. +
**Alternative 2:** Make the birthday field optional. +
**Pros:** More user-friendly. +
**Cons: Implementation is slightly more tedious and new developers might need more time to understand the implementation. **

=== ListBirthday Mechanism

The listbirthday command displays the list of contacts in Contags whose birthdays fall on the current date. The list is sorted in order of the list according to the `updateFilteredPersonsList`.

The lisbirthday command is facilitated by the `BirthdayChecker` class in the person class. Take note that the listbirthday command is not an undoable command and hence inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand` (see design considerations below).

The BirthdayChecker class checks if a contact's birthday falls on the current date by checking if the month and day of the contact's birthday and current date are equal. This is done so by converting the month and day first to a string, which is then converted to a date object and finally a calendar object.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Whether the listbirthday should be an executable command that requires manual typing of the command each time.
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** listbirthday is a command and users would have to type that every time they want to find out if a contact's birthday falls on that day.
**Pros:** Easy to implement and easy for new developers to understand and work on it.
**Cons:** Not as user friendly as users would have to manually key in the command every time.
**Alternative 2:** List of contacts whose birthdays falls on the current day appear as a popup every time the app is started.
**Pros:** More user friendly as users would not have to type the command every day. Users might forget to type the command everyday to check if any of their contact's birthday is on the current date.
**Cons:** Implementation is more tedious.
**Alternative 3:** List the contacts whose birthdays fall within a week from the current date.
**Pros:** More user friendly as users might want to know whose birthday is nearing.
**Cons:** More tedious to implement.

=== Social Media

The Social Media display consists of several parts. Firstly, there is the social media url field contained within the `Person` class. +
This field is an optional one that does not have to be included in the `add` command when adding new a new contact.

The second part is the `toggle` command, which modifies a class-level variable within the `BrowserPanel` class.
[source,java]
----
public class BrowserPanel extends UiPart<Region> {
    private static Boolean browserMode = true;
}
----

By default, the variable is true, and it will cause the `select` command to display the contact's address. +
When it is toggled, the `select` command will cause the `select` command to follow the url specified in the social media url field instead.

The following sequence diagram shows the execution of the SelectCommand, including the `toggle` mechanism. The execution of the ToggleCommand is excluded for brevity.

image::SocialMediaSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.4a : Social Media sequence diagram_

The mechanism of the SelectCommand remains intact. However, the changes are in the execution within BrowserPanel based on the state of the boolean variable.

After toggling, instead of retrieving the contact's address and opening a Google Maps page, it will follow the url of the contact's social media field

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of social media display in BrowserPanel +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new command to toggle the function of select, and display only either the address or social media page at one one +
**Pros:** The windows will be less cramped and we do not need to have double the resources used to open 2 BrowserPanels simultaneously +
**Cons:** We have to implement 2 separate sets of logic, and link it to a variable that determines the current behaviour +
**Alternative 2:** Open 2 BrowserPanels side by side when select is called, one displaying address and the other displaying the social media page +
**Pros:** It allows the user to utilise both functions simultaneously +
**Cons:** It consumes a large amount of resources and the resulting panels will both be small, reducing the functionality of the 2 panels.

---

**Aspect:** Method of selecting which display to be shown +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Toggled via independent command +
**Pros:** The option is saved, so when users want to view multiple contacts consecutively, they can minimise the number of commands they use or the amount of input keyed in. +
**Cons:** A separate command needs to be implemented and linked to both the BrowserPanel and Select Command +
**Alternative 2:** Enter choice in the select command +
**Pros:** When users want to alternate between functions, it will be easier and require fewer commands. +
**Cons:** Complicates the Select Command.

=== Sort Mechanism

The sort command sorts the `person` in `Contags` based on their `Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Address` or `Tag`. The implementation of `SortCommand` inherits from `Command`. Sorting currently works in ascending order only. +

There is also the use of the `SortCommandParser`, which implements the `Parser` interface, that parses out the keywords to be used with the `sort` command. The `SortCommandParser` checks for the correct keywords used and also allows the keywords to be case-insensitive.  +

[NOTE]
If arguments entered by the user do not comply with the correct format, ParseException will be thrown before execution of the method. +

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Attributes to sort +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** List of contacts can be sorted by `Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Address` or `Tag`. +
**Pros:** Gives users the ability to change the sorting of the list by different attributes. +
**Cons:** Most of the attributes are unique and thus sorting by phone or email or address may not be very useful. +
**Alternative 2:** List of contacts can be sorted by `Name` only. +
**Pros:** Useful for most users who may want to view a sorted list of contacts. +
**Cons:** Not useful for users who may want to sort based on other attributes such as phone or address.

---

**Aspect:** How the sort command works +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** List of contacts is sorted in alphabetical order in ascending order. +
**Pros:** Easier to implement than including descending order. +
**Cons:** Sort command has less functionality, some users may want a descending order for some use cases. +
**Alternative 2:** List of contacts is sorted in alphabetical order, and can be in either ascending or descending order as decided by user. +
**Pros:** Has more functionality, more user-friendly. +
**Cons:** Harder to implement and develop. +

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`.
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`.

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`).

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our project. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. Contags depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing.

Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than the following alternatives:

* Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size). +
* Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers).

[appendix]
== User Stories

The user stories here depict the various types of features and considerations that you, as a developer, may have for the users of Contags. These user stories serve as a guide towards the features that you should create for users. +

Priorities: +
            `* * \*` - High (must have), +
            `* \*` - Medium (nice to have), +
            `*` - Low (Not very important to have).
